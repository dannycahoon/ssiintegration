---

## Objectives

- In this Lab we are going to use Self Serevice Integration; referred to as SSI, to create a recipe that will take contacts (i.e., First Name and Last Name) that were added to Google Contacts and add them to a Google Sheets document.

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab.
- An Oracle Public Cloud account for SSI that will be supplied by your instructor.
- Google Account.
- Access to create Google Contacts.
- Access to create Google Sheets.
    Have a Sheet with 2 columns: First Name and Last Name

As a result of this lab we seek to familiarize you with Oracle Self Service Integration (SSI) and hands-on experiance working with a recipe integration. We will explore the main parts of Self Service Integration (SSI). You will acquire a good overview of the Oracle Self Service Integration (SSI), an integration platform for Line of Business users. You will explore various consoles and capabilities to create recipes that bridge the gap and disconnect of personal productivity apps that need connectivity to your Enterprise systems of record. The exercise will get your familiar with all the tooling available to work with this cloud service.
