As a result of this lab we seek to familiarize you with Oracle Self Service Integration (SSI) and hands-on experiance working with a recipe integration. We will explore the main parts of Self Service Integration (SSI). You will acquire a good overview of the Oracle Self Service Integration (SSI), an integration platform for Line of Business users. You will explore various consoles and capabilities to create recipes that bridge the gap and disconnect of personal productivity apps that need connectivity to your Enterprise systems of record. The exercise will get your familiar with all the tooling available to work with this cloud service. 

We’ll look at the following:
